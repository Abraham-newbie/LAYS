This repository contains the submission for the following task:

```
1-2 pager analyzing learning-adjusted years of schooling in Africa relative to other regions with key insights and takeaways. 

```
## [1-2 Pager](https://github.com/Abraham-newbie/oxford_submission/blob/main/RA_Oxford_Submission.pdf)

A write-up on 'The State of Schooling in Africa: A LAYS Perspective', where I use multiple World Bank datasets, including data from Harmonized Learning Outcomes (HLO) Database and the Human Capital Project to review the state of schooling in Africa.



## [RShiny App](https://econ-newbie.shinyapps.io/rshinyapp/)

I also developed a simple RShiny app as an extension to the task, which allows you to visualize Learning outcomes such as LAYS, EYS and HLO. You can find the app [here](https://econ-newbie.shinyapps.io/rshinyapp/).

The shiny app uses the Harmonized Learning Outcomes Database and World Bank Human Capital Project Data to provide simple interactive visualizations.



## Code and Data
The code and data are organized in the repository in their respective folders.
